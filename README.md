### Hi there 👋

# You can call me 'Cloud' or 'Anclaudys' 👽❤️

## My story... 
I used to be a bilingual children's coding instructor where I exposed the children of my underserved and underrepresented community to the creative and practical aspects of technology by using Lego Robotics, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Linux, and Scratch. 

I left teaching to pursue my passion for code and to become the best software engineer that I can be so that I can set an example for my community and inspire us to achive greatness.




## Some facts about me
- 🔭 I’m currently studying data structures and algorithms. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graph algorithms in network routing (Surprisingly, this is a relatively more leisurely activity compared to grinding algos and ds problems). 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require more back-end work.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with dynamic programming. I want to improve there. 
- 💬 Ask me about Linux! If you are running a server that uses Linux, I can make it do many things... ;)
