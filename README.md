### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Anclaudys. In the anglophone world, I am known as "Cloud". 

I used to be a bilingual children's coding instructor where I exposed the children of my underserved and underrepresented community to the creative and practical aspects of technology by using Lego Robotics, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Linux, and Scratch. 

I left teaching to pursue my passion for code and to become the best software engineer that I can be so that I can set an example for my community and inspire us to achive greatness.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying data structures and algorithms. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning graph algorithms in network routing (Surprisingly, this is a relatively more leisurely activity compared to grinding algos and ds problems). 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that require more back-end work.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with dynamic programming. I want to improve there. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux! If you are running a server that uses Linux, I can make it do many things... ;)

- âš¡ Fun fact:  I'm teaching my 11 year old sister Hannah how to code. She's such a brilliant person!
